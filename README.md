# A/B Hypothesis Testing

This project demonstrates A/B hypothesis testing using Python and Google Colab. 
The analysis compares click rates between two groups (Group A and Group B) 
to determine if the color change affects user behavior.

## Files
- `ab_testing.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook with the analysis.

## Statistical Methods Used
- Two-sample t-test
- Chi-square test (optional)

## How to Use
- Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
- Run the cells step by step to replicate the analysis.
